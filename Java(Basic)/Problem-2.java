//Algorithm Discussion on Problem 2

/* The below problem solving algorithm approach is mine ; it's upto a programmer how efficiently they can optimize the solution. */

The second coding problem in my assessment test was about :
    
                                                        How to compare a string, an integer values and arrays . 
                                                        
                                                        Using comparator interface- Comparator interface is used to order the objects of user-defined class. 
                                                        
                                                        This interface is present in java.util package and contains 2 methods compare(Object obj1, Object obj2) 
                                                        
                                                        and equals(Object element). Using comparator, we can sort the elements based on data members. 
                                                        
                                                        For instance it may be on rollno, name, age or anything else.

    Method of Collections class for sorting List elements is used to sort the elements of List by the given comparator.
    
    Ex:
    
    boolean equals(Object obj)
    
    obj is the object to be tested for equality. The method returns true if obj and the invoking object are both Comparator objects and use the same ordering. 
    
    Otherwise, it returns false.
